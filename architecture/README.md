## Learning Goal
In this exercise, you will take the game rules&mdash;in software engineering terms, the software specification&mdash;and derive the software architecture that implements the battleship game. You will learn how to use the Unified Modeling Language (UML2) to describe your architecure using a so-called class diagram.

## Deliverables
A UML class diagram specifying a software architecture that implements the battleship game based on the given game rules.

## Hints
* Become familiar with the OOP fundamentals like classes and inheritance
* You might want to familiarize yourself with Domain-Driven Design (DDD) first. Even after 20 years, Eric Evan's seminal book "Domain-Driven Design" is probably the best place to start
* An alternative to drawing UML diagrams by hand (digital or analog) is [PlantUML](https://plantuml.com). This little tool takes textual descriptions of UML diagrams and renders them in a graphical format like PNG or PDF. Working with textual descriptions has an additional advantage that you can [treat your diagrams as code](https://www.writethedocs.org/guide/docs-as-code/)
