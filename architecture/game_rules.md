THE PLAYING AREA
I have always used a playing surface marked out in squares and with ships' speeds and weapon ranges therefore given in so many squares per move. I am aware that many other naval war gamers feel that in using this method an opportunity for exercising some additional skill is lost. They prefer to have no set board and make movement and range estimation dependent on the use of the tape measure. The player firing his guns, in fact, calls out his estimate of the target's range, and only after this is the actual distance measured and hits or misses recorded.
The player's skill at estimating thus becomes a feature of the game. As against this the players lose the greatest asset of the gridded area which is that submarine warfare and mining operations can be carried out by two players without the use of an umpire since all unseen activities can be plotted on duplicate, and hidden, charts.
For the playing surface I use pieces of thick card of light-blue colour 25in by on, each ruled in dark blue to give the same number of squares (eighty) on each. This stiff card was obtained from a high-quality stationers and is tough enough to withstand frequent usage, yet light enough for taking to other war gamers' homes. I can line up two or more sections of card according to whether I want a long and narrow playing area, a square one, a small area or a large one. As they are not joined but lie neatly alongside each other, I can remove areas of sea which are clearly no longer needed as the game pro-ceeds. In order to be able to identify each square for the purposes of submarine searches and the laying or clearing of minefields, I have a series of strips of card in contrasting colours enabling me to identify every square of the board by a code consisting of a letter and a number. The diagram shows this for a playing area consisting of three sections.

HARBOURS, ISLANDS AND COASTLINES
The inclusion of a harbour or two in a game enables ships to go back to them for repairs and for an opponent to have a lovely time laying traps, perhaps with a submarine or a minefield, for the returning ship or for reinforcements hurrying out to sea.

Islands or coastlines can add interest to a battle area. They may mask a ship's gunfire, or a player may skilfully deploy mines and ships between them in order to lure his opponent into a battle zone of his own choosing. The capture of a certain number of islands may be the objective in a particular game.

￼

OBJECTIVE OF THE GAME
This is generally agreed upon in advance, but if an umpire is being used then he can be asked to define reasonable conditions for victory for each side and announce when one or the other has been attained. Objectives can be as simple as sinking more of the enemy's ships than one loses, getting a certain proportion of a convoy from one place to another, or hunting down a raider. Or points can be given for attaining a number of objectives, victory going to the player first attaining the agreed total quota. I have always admired Waddington's game "Buccaneer' which, set in the sailing-ship era, allows each player to choose any combination of methods to attain the winning points total of treasure. By building into a game more than one possible objective, players find there is more scope for independent action. Conversely, if the victory condition is such that it encourages a massive confrontation of all the ships taking part in the game, then the action will be tedious indeed.

ALLOCATING THE SHIPS
Many war gamers find it simple enough to share out ships before a game in an equable fashion merely by knowing the capabilities of the real ones. For example, one British battlecruiser of World War I can be equated with a German one with smaller-calibre guns because the latter was better protected. Or one Bismarck may be said to equal one Hood and one Prince of Wales, but only if the rules allow for Hood's vulnerability to plunging fire and the Prince of Wales's rawness. In any case, it is neither essential nor necessarily desirable to have equal sides in all game situations. But the reader who prefers to apportion ships according to more precise values can draw up a formula which gives each ship a points value based on its capabilities. It might follow the lines of Fletcher Pratt's formula, mentioned in Chapter 3, or it can be made somewhat simpler. Such a formula requires that each characteristic of the ship be given a points value, and that these points be aggregated to give a grand total.
Thus such factors as a ship's speed, its resistance to damage (sinking rate), the guns, torpedoes, aircraft and mines it carries, and its anti-aircraft rating will all be calculated. But I must confess that I have never been entirely happy with the end results of my own formula and still prefer to apportion fleets after amicable bargaining with an opponent.

SHIP CARDS
At this point in the preparations for a game, may I recommend that the war gamer prepare a card for each of his ships? Each card should show the ship's name, displacement, weapons, speed, distribution of armour, and any important variants amongst ships of the same class. Then, in pencil, the gamer can add details relevant to war gaming, for example, the points needed to sink a ship, the anti-aircraft rating of the ship, the points value of the ship for allocation purposes. I say in pencil because the war gamer is almost bound to have second thoughts about these various values as he gains experience and amends his rules, and will want to alter that part of the card. The use of cards makes it easy to hand a player the complete details of his fleet for a particular action, whereas if these are contained in your master set of rules or war-game file you will waste time consulting them from amongst many others. The card looks like this one:

￼

For each game it is necessary to record damage to ships, the numbers of torpedoes used up, adjustments to speed. I use simple sheets which I have had duplicated and on these the combatant ships are entered. The next figure shows how an American squadron's sheet looked at the end of a successful defence of a convoy against a Japanese attack. This shows that Iowa sank after sustaining more than 900 points of damage, most of it coming from six torpedo hits of 120 points each. Oakland was sunk by the battleship Musashi, apparently without having fired her torpedoes, whereas Jenkins, sunk by assorted gunfire, had loosed off both sets of her ten torpedo tubes. Fletcher had used up her torpedoes and had suffered enough damage to lose one square in speed per game move. Radford had fired five of her ten torpedoes.

￼

We are now armed with a playing surface, ships' record cards and sheets for recording damage in combat. A dozen dice, preferably of the large variety, and a cup which can take them all if necessary, completes the equipment for the moment.
Your ships are in harbour, eager to set off for what may well prove to be costly combat. What happens now?

￼

MOVEMENT OF SHIPS
Each player moves any or all of his ships up to the maximum number of squares allowed. Changing course is rather like making the knight's move in chess, and if a 180° turn is involved one square in speed is lost. Some examples are shown in Fig 5.
The ship should be left unambiguously at right angles to the sides of the square or on the diagonal as this affects its vulnerability to torpedo attacks and its movement next turn. The ship's bridge and funnels should lie in the centre of the square.
Except in harbour or when re-provisioning at sea, no ship of above 3,500 tons can occupy a square with another. In practice this means two destroyers, four motor torpedo boats or one cruiser or larger occupy a square. Ships can, however, pass through a square occupied by other ships.

￼

So our fleet moves out to sea. Let us say that it consists of a battleship, two in gun cruisers and four destroyers. It might be disposed as in Fig 6 to give reasonable protection to the battleship. The destroyers will be using detection equipment to ask if a submarine is under any of the squares over which they pass although such equipment would not be available for World War I situations. The cruisers are protecting the battle-ship's flanks from destroyer attack and can be sent off quickly to investigate anything suspicious. The battleship is a 25 knot vessel, the cruisers 32 knot vessels and the destroyers 35 knot vessels, so if the group is to move along together it will travel at the battleship's speed. The normal range of speeds encountered in the game can be summarised in the following table:

￼


To employ this wide range of speeds I give myself the slight inconvenience of having to move some vessels more squares in one move than in the next. As an aide-mémoire a card is displayed and it is turned round on the conclusion of each game move. Players could take it in turn to move first or dice for choice each time. I believe that a good compromise is to go first alternately. The sequence of moves, together with any fighting necessary, becomes:

￼


SINKING THE ENEMY'S SHIP
All ships have a sinking rate, a number which once exceeded in damage points whether from shells, torpedoes, bombs, depth charges or mines means that that ship is sunk. Even the small guns of destroyers are deemed capable of causing larger armoured ships damage perhaps in damaging equipment, killing personnel, causing fires, all of which can contribute to a ship's destruction. As progressive stages of the total are passed so turrets are deemed out of action and the ship's speed reduced. How the reader arrives at a sinking rate for each ship is a matter of personal preference. I like my battleships to have a rate in the range 700 to 1,200 points. Smaller vessels are then scaled down accordingly. These figures were arrived at originally by estimating how many points of torpedo hits or gunfire might realistically be regarded as sufficient to sink different types of ship. Thus if your reading suggests that a World War II battleship of average proportions and armour would sink after nine torpedo hits, then its sinking rate can be regarded as nine times one conventional torpedo's damage capability, ie 9 × 100 = 900 points. A destroyer of 1,300 tons or so has a sinking rate of fifty-five points.

Other war gamers attempt to arrive at a more accurate assessment of a ship's capacity to absorb punishment by considering all its known armour characteristics and relating these by a formula, much as Fletcher Pratt did in his rules. In the table below I give some specimen sinking rates for some warships in the period 1914 to 1945. They were arrived at by consulting reference books for the armour distribution of each vessel, the degree of compartmentalisation and the actual performance of a ship under fire if known. The last point is an interesting one. Some warships served their turn and passed on into history without ever having come under severe attack.
Others, such as the German battlecruiser Seydlitz in World War I took a tremendous pounding and testified to the excellent design features of this class of ship.

SUGGESTED SINKING RATES
￼

FIRING GUNS
Let us say that our squadron of ships has come into range of an enemy warship -an 8in gun cruiser. Combat occurs once both players have completed their moves. It does not matter who elects to do the firing first as the firing is deemed simultaneous so that no ship is removed from the board as sunk or loses turrets until all firing on both sides has taken place. Ranges are soon memorised. The following are based on official data wherever possible, but some sources vary in estimates of how far guns could fire. The examples are for the most common naval guns of both wars and are based on the premise that 5,000yd actual range is equal to one game-board square.

￼

From the above list it will be seen that some guns of seemingly identical calibre will vary in range according to their age or elevation allowed by the turrets. The British Queen Elizabeth and Royal Sovereign classes had the same 15in guns in both wars, but the turrets of the former had been modernised so the guns' range far exceeded those of the unmodified class of battleships.

A vessel in range of another fires any of the main armament which can be brought to bear and a dice is thrown for each gun fired. Ranges are counted out in squares as with movement (see figure below). 

￼

If the guns are firing at maximum range only sixes count as hits. At ranges less than the maximum, fives also count as hits. Should the rate of fire of a particular calibre of gun be such as to allow a further third or fourth set of throws, then another target can be engaged applying the same criteria as above. But if the second, third or fourth firings are aimed at the same target, then the accuracy of their fire is deemed greater and fours, fives and sixes all count as hits.

The following table shows what damage is done by a shell of a particular size. The figures are based approximately on the known weights of shells. The rate of fire of various guns is given too.

￼

It will be readily seen that the information contained in the two previous tables can all be placed in columns on one large piece of paper or card and can thus be consulted easily during a game. After the main armament has been fired the same procedure is followed for any secondary or tertiary guns which can be brought to bear.

FIRING TORPEDOES
Torpedoes may be fired when the range permits. Their range and capability for damage is:

￼

I insist that torpedoes fired from ships are fired as sets. Thus, a destroyer with two sets of four tubes must fire all four of one set at the same target and only then switch targets and fire the other set. Or, of course, he may fire both sets at the same target.
Used in this way some torpedoes will be wasted as one hit alone might have sunk the target whereas two or more torpedo hits actually registered. But this makes for interesting decisions often taken by the player concerned at great speed as he strives to inflict the most damage to the most ships for the least expenditure of his fire power. In contrast to gunfire I make allowance for the angle the target presents to the attacking ship when deciding the chances of a torpedo hitting it. It is important therefore that all ships are placed quite unambiguously on their squares at the end of the movement turn. The three examples of a ship attacked by torpedoes in the figure below apply whether the torpedoes are launched by surface vessel, submarine or aircraft.


While all this firing goes on the players must keep a careful account on their damage sheets of damage incurred and torpedo tubes fired. Gun turrets are knocked out, starting with the main ones of the defender's choice, and speed is reduced at the following rates.

￼

TAKING ON MORE TORPEDOES
I only allow a torpedo-carrying vessel, except the submarine, to have torpedoes sufficient for one firing from each of its tubes. If it needs more it must return to port and stay there for one movement turn or go alongside a depot ship at sea. In the latter case it may move at the depot ship's speed but cannot use its armaments in the game move during which it takes on extra torpedoes. Surfaced submarines may also use a depot ship's facilities but may not submerge until the loading operation is completed.

REPAIRS
To regain the ship's full sinking rate the damaged vessel must return to port and miss one complete game move for each 10 per cent of the total sinking rate restored. Its weapons, except anti-aircraft ones, cannot be used in harbour. It may leave harbour at any stage of its repairs and will sometimes need to do so if a desperate situation has arisen at sea.

MINELAYING AND MINESWEEPING
A square of sea is deemed sown with ten mines if the minesweeper of thirty knots or more passes over that square. If a slower vessel is used, then it must stay on the square for one whole move. The ship's cargo of mines is used up at the rate of ten mines per square sown.

When an enemy ship passes over a mined square, the player announces the fact. Two dice are thrown. All scores except two sixes are deemed hits, the aggregate being multiplied by ten to give the damage registered. Thus the least a ship will be damaged is 10 (I + 1) or 20 points, the most 10 (6 + 5) or 110 points. The former was probably a mine detonating at some distance, the latter a direct explosion from underneath. The minefield remains active until ten vessels have passed over it or it is cleared.

Only vessels designated as minesweepers can go on a mined square and not suffer damage. It takes one minesweeper two whole game moves to clear a square, but as minesweepers are generally small vessels, up to four could be used on any square and thus it could be swept in just the time the ships take to pass through the square.

CHANGING WEATHER CONDITIONS
These are easily introduced although they are not always worth the bother in a short game. The playing area is divided into four zones for weather purposes. Before each game move a dice is thrown for each zone with the following results: six denotes fog; five and four denote high seas; three, two and one denote good visibility and moderate sea conditions.
For one whole game move the appropriate weather prevails in each of the four zones and cards showing this are placed alongside the zones. Where high seas are running, all ships below 10,000 tons displacement drop a square in speed and carrier aircraft may not be launched or retrieved whilst submarines cannot fire torpedoes. Where fog is the hazard all ships reduce their speed to one square per move, all planes are confined to their carrier, no ships can fire except for their depth charges and ships are removed from the playing area and replaced by discs for that move. This introduces an element of hidden movement especially if the next game move brings a continuance of the fog or some dises/ships can move into a one where fog prevails.

NIGHT ACTIONS
Again, these are best used when time is not at a premium.
Four whole game moves make up one night, eight one whole day. Movement by night on the playing chart is with discs, not models. The name of the ship represented by the disc is written on the reverse side and is, of course, known only to the player of that fleet. Planes are grounded.

HIDDEN MOVEMENT TO START A GAME
A screen placed across the centre of the playing chart for the first two or three game moves allows players to deploy their ships secretly and thus makes subsequent moves more interest-ing. A variation on this is to dice for the point at which a ship or ships will enter the playing area. This will sometimes put ships closer to each other than the competing players would have preferred.
