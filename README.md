## Introduction
This repository contains programming exercises to illustrate the most important concepts in object-oriented programming (OOP). It also includes example solutions in Python 3.

To make learning fun, the exercises implement a battleship game. The game rules are a simplified version of the rules suggested by Barry Carter in his excellent book "Naval Wargames".

## OOP Concepts
In terms of OOP, the exercises covering the following topiocs:several topics including:
* Basics of OOP
* Classes vs instances (methods and variables)
* Data abstraction
* Encapsulation
* Classes as data types
* Inheritence
* Polymorphism
* Dynamic dispatching

Potential further topics:
* Dependency injection
* SOLID
* GRASP
* Metaprogramming
* Decorators
