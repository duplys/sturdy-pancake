## Summary
This repository contains code examples and coding exercises to illustrate various programming concepts and software architecture principles.

To make learning a hands-on, interactive and fun experience, `architecture` folder contains a simplified version of battleship game rules suggested by Barry Carter in his excellent book "Naval Wargames". The game can be used for exercises in software architecture and software engineering.

## Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) Concepts
Code examples illustrating concepts in object-oriented programming (OOP) cover:
* OOP basics (classes, methods, members)
* Classes vs instances (methods and variables)
* Data abstraction
* Encapsulation
* Classes as data types
* Inheritence
* Polymorphism
* Dynamic dispatching

## SOLID Principles
Code examples illustrating the software architecture principles from Bob Martin's Clean Architecture (SOLID):
* Single-responsibility principle
* Open-closed principle
* Liskov substitution principle
* Interface segregation principle
* Dependency inversion principle

## Potential further topics
* Dependency injection
* GRASP
* Metaprogramming
* Decorators
